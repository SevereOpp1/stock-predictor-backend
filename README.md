Usage

The backend expects a POST request with JSON data:

{ "ticker": "AAPL" }


It responds with a prediction result:

{"predictions":[{"down_prob":28.268155455589294,"up_prob":71.73184156417847}]}

down_prob: probability stock price dips below yesterday's close
up_prob: probability stock price rises above yesterday's close
